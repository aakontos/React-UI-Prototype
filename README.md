# React UI Prototype for DukeDS

###### This project serves as a Prototype User Interface for the Duke Data Service Desktop Application. The purpose for creating the Desktop Application is to help Medical and Scientific Researchers at Duke University create more reproducible and transparent data. By creating a desktop application, one is more easily able to upload source and result files and connect them with a short description of how the data was manipulated.

The User Interface was created in the JavaScript Library React. This was done both to allow me to practice with JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and web development languages, but also because of its ease of access in creating user interfaces and front-end applications. The final application will be written in Python for more ease of integration.


The Prototype is designed for a window sized at 800 x 600, so if downloaded and used in browser with yarn or NPM, the dimensions may be different than intended.
